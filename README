Bunch of utilities to convert python dictionaries to TextMate and SublimeText
related property lists. The advantages of using python dictionaries over plain
JSON or YAML conversions are modularity, and the full power of python, like
variables, on-the-fly string generation or dictionary manipulations. These are
truly helpful assets while writing these XML snippets for all the compatible
text-editors.
